# The Fibonacci Sequence

This is the quintessential classic exercise. It helps in understanding how the current state depends on previous states.

## Problem Description
Write a program that generates and displays the first $N$ terms of the Fibonacci sequence. The series starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones.

### Formula
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

Where:
* $F_0 = 0$
* $F_1 = 1$

## Specifications

### Input
An integer $N$ representing the quantity of terms to display.

### Output
The sequence of numbers separated by commas.

## Sample Run

| Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | `7` |
| **Output** | `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8` |
